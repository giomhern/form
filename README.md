## Running the program

First, make sure you have Go install by running the following in your terminal:

```bash
go version

```

This should show you the current version of Go if installed correctly.

Then, run the following to make sure everything is imported correctly (we have minimal imports here so should be no issue!):

```bash
go mod tidy

```

Lastly, run the program:

```bash
go run .

```

And have a blast interacting with the input-friendly TUI! :)
